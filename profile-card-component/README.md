## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox 


### What I learned

* To not be afraid of the `div` element
* Keep the code lines as simple as possible 
* Use semantic HTML elements more effectively 

#### Code lines that stood out to me
HTML
```
<div class="user-info">
<h3 id="user-name">Victor Crest<span class="age">26</span></h3>
</div>
```
CSS
```
.card{
  position: relative;
  display: flex;
	flex-direction: column;
	justify-content: center;
	width: 300px;
	height: max-content;
}
```


### Continued development

As I continue my coding journey, I want to improve on and implement the following techniques:

* CSS Flexbox
* CSS positioning 
* CSS pseudo selectors
